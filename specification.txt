Game with computer players that are continuously created and destroyed, only the most fit being
reproduced--genetic algorithm. 

The game:
Players are different colors--like representing species. There will be 3 colors: RYB.
Players can collect "food." Eating food increases health. Health decreases over time.
Players can "see" distances to food.
The fitness function is simply a measure of length of life--the longer the life, the better the
score.

Sensor layout:

Physical sensors on the front half of the player, one on each side. There are 2 sensor
nodes.
A food sensor on each side will tell what is the distance to the nearest food in that direction.
   
The input sensor nodes in the input array will be in the following order:
 - Left food
 - Right food
   
Neural Networks in the players will consist of a basic forward propogation network with the
above listed inputs and the following outputs:
 - a binary output determining weather the player is building wall at this moment or not.
   When the output is positive or 0 the player builds; at negative he does not. The walls 
   will be a pretty visual, but unnecessary. The players will need to evolve to ignore this 
   output. I am curious what patterns we may see with this though.
 - an output which determines the speed at which the player moves forward (or backward for 
   negative values). A value of 1.0 represents full speed.
 - an output which determines how much the player is turning during the current update, a 
   negative value being left and a positive value being right. A value of -1.0 or 1.0 represent
   the tightest possible turn.
   
There are 3 output nodes. They will be in the following order in the output array:
 - speed
 - directional change
 - build wall
